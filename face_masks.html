    <h1>Emi The Face Mask Maker</h1>
    <div class="general">

        <p class="main-text">
                Hi, I'm Emi. I'm a rising high school senior at the Commonwealth School, near Copley. I live in Union Square, Somerville.
                Since fabric face masks became an important part of protecting against covid, I have been 
                working to develop and produce quality face masks. Initially, these face masks were only for family,
                close friends, and donation to Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA), but since the start of summer, I have
                been expanding my business, and currently I sell face masks in addition to donating and gifting.<br><br>
                Specifications for face masks that hold true unless otherwise specified:<br>
                Face masks are made with two layers of 100% cotton material, at least one layer of which is quilters' cotton. They have a slit so that one can choose to 
                insert a filter, which is more necessary in some masks than others, depending on the thickness and quality 
                of the cotton. In theory, masks made with two layers of quilters cotton (or other high thread count material) do not really require an additional filter. 
                Almost all masks are made with elastic that goes through channels on the sides and around the back 
                of the head, ensuring a "one size fits all" that really does fit almost everyone.<br>
                I generally sell masks for $10 each, but I gratefully accept extra donations.<br>
                Furthermore, I am happy for the face mask payment to be made to CHA, or another local charity, just please 
                let me know that that's what you are doing. <br>
                I take payment by cash, check (I think?), and Venmo. <br>
                If you live within a 5 mile radius of Union Square, Somerville, I deliver masks by bike. Otherwise, I have 
                discovered that a singular mask ships for the same price as a letter.<br><br>
                Note on timing and availability:<br>
                I am mostly working by myself, in batches of 2 to 20 masks of a single pattern at a time. Some fabrics come from 
            small donations, and as such have limited availability. Some masks come from a batch that hasn't been started yet 
            and as such may take a long time to be ready. A mask pattern that you like may not still be available by the time 
            you ask for it as in-person requests can take precedence.<br><br>
            Note on exceptions and alterations:<br>
            I take special requests. If they are interesting enough, I do not require payment. I also am usually willing to 
            take a fabric of your choice and transform it into masks for you. I also accept donations of labor, food, materials, 
            or other forms of bartering in liu of payment. <br>
            If you would like a mask that in any way deviates from the specifications laid out at the beginning of this long spiel, 
            please let me know. <br>
            I also make pro bono masks, sometimes. If you know a group of people who would strongly benefit from machine washable face masks and don't 
            already have a plan to get some, please let me know. My personal limit for this is ~20 masks, but if it's really important, I might be 
            able to get help from the rest of the sewing group. This pro bono work includes making face masks for eployees (and possibly their volunteers) 
            of local businesses that are suffering due to covid.<br><br>

    <h2>
        Images of available fabrics for face masks!</h2>
        <p>
        Right now, this isn't super well set up, but here are pictures of the current fabrics. You may have to zoom in to see them properly. You request a mask by its number, counting from left to right, 
        top to bottom, including crossed out squares. For example, the face masks with planets on them would be number 11. Masks patterns that have been crossed out are either temporarily or permanently unavailable. 
        If you have already requested it, this unavailability might be due to you, and you should not worry! (but if you are worried, don't hesitate to reach out!)

            <img float=left src="resources/moon.JPG" alt="moon">
            <p> One morning, the moon seemed really bright against the sky, and I tried to capture it.

        <div class="caption-duo">
            <img src="resources/diagonal lights.JPG">
            <p> For awhile, I was leaving for school quite a bit before sunrise, and the glare of the 
                street lights against the purple background was quite appealing.
            </p>
        </div>
    
    
        <div class="caption-duo">
            <img src="resources/snowy streetlight.jpg">
            <p>Again, I was fascinated by the contrast of the snow and the lights and the dark pink-purple-blue sky.</p>
     </div>   
   
        <div class="caption-duo">
            <img src="resources/pretty sky.JPG">
            <p>On cold, damp, slightly cloudy days, the sky is absolutely georgeous when only lit from behind.</p>
        </div>
        <div margin-left="6vw" class="caption-duo">
            <img src="resources/sunrise taxi.JPG">
            <p>One day, the sky had this beautiful ripple pattern, kind of like sand on a beach (in coloring, too), and I took a ton of pictures. 
                The bright, glaring yellow of the taxi stood out nicely against the more muted tones of the sky and buildings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="caption-duo">
            <img src="resources/ripple sky.jpeg">
            <p>From another view point, I could capture more of the sky, without the taxi.</p>

        <div class="caption-duo">
            <img src="resources/street poles.JPG">
            <p>The sky is cut into vertical strips of color against the darker poles and building.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="caption-duo">
            <img src="resources/flooded street.jpg">
            <p>In capturing the annoyance of a flooded street (which I then had to cross to get to 
                the bus stop), I also caught a very clear reflection of the trees and buildings on the other side.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="caption-duo">
            <img src="resources/haymarket reflection.JPG">
            <p>Bus and train windows also provide an interesting opportunity for a partial reflection that gives
                the appearance of two images on top of each other.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="caption-duo">
            <img src="resources/crisscross wires.JPG">
            <p>At another green line stop, I captured the sky and all the wires going across.</p>
        </div>
   
        <div class="caption-duo">
                <img src="resources/trolley snacks.JPG">
                <p>This sign is apparently a green line relic from long ago when they had food. I found it
                    interesting and the lighting appealing.
                </p>

        <div class="caption-duo">
            <img src="resources/copley unlocked.JPG">
            <p>One day on the way home from school, I discovered the gate at Copley wide open and thought 
                to document it for posterity. The composition turned out well too, I think.

        <div class="caption-duo">
            <img src="resources/sunset through windows.JPG">
            <p>I love to take pictures of sunsets. Most of the time I'm on the train though, so I have to take
                the pictures through the windows. This yields interesting results.

        </div>
        <div class="caption-duo">
            <img src="resources/sunset.JPG">
            <p>One time, I did successfully capture the sunset without a window, and the sky looked streaky,
                 almost as if it were painted.</p>
