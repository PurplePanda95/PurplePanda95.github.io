        <p class="main-text">
                Hi, I'm Emi. I'm a rising high school senior at the Commonwealth School, near Copley, in Boston, MA. I live in Union Square, Somerville, MA, USA.
                Since fabric face masks became an important part of protecting against covid, I have been 
                working to develop and produce quality face masks. Initially, these face masks were only for family,
                close friends, and donation to Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA), but since the start of summer, I have
                been expanding my business, and currently I sell face masks in addition to donating and gifting.<br><br>
                Specifications for face masks that hold true unless otherwise specified:<br>
                Face masks are made with two layers of 100% cotton material, at least one layer of which is quilters' cotton. I try to purchase as much of my materials from Sewfisticated as possible, because they have the best quality (and definitely the best prices), and I like to support local business.
                All masks have a slit so that one can choose to 
                insert a filter, which is more necessary in some masks than others, depending on the thickness and quality 
                of the cotton. In theory, masks made with two layers of quilters cotton (or other high thread count material) do not really require an additional filter. 
                Almost all masks are made with elastic that goes through channels on the sides and around the back 
                of the head, ensuring a "one size fits all" that really does fit almost everyone.<br>
                I generally sell masks for $10 each, but I gratefully accept extra donations.<br>
                Furthermore, I am happy for the face mask payment to be made to CHA, or another local charity, just please 
                let me know that that's what you are doing. <br>
                I take payment by cash, check (I think?), and Venmo. <br>
                If you live within a 5 mile radius of Union Square, Somerville, I deliver masks by bike. Otherwise, I have 
                discovered that a singular mask ships for the same price as a letter.<br><br>
                Note on timing and availability:<br>
                I am mostly working by myself, in batches of 2 to 20 masks of a single pattern at a time. Some fabrics come from 
            small donations, and as such have limited availability. Some masks come from a batch that hasn't been started yet 
            and as such may take a long time to be ready. A mask pattern that you like may not still be available by the time 
            you ask for it as in-person requests can take precedence.<br><br>
            Note on exceptions and alterations:<br>
            I take special requests. If they are interesting enough, I do not require payment. I also am usually willing to 
            take a fabric of your choice and transform it into masks for you. I also accept donations of labor, food, materials, 
            or other forms of bartering in liu of payment. <br>
            If you would like a mask that in any way deviates from the specifications laid out at the beginning of this long spiel, 
            please let me know. <br>
            I also make pro bono masks, sometimes. If you know a group of people who would strongly benefit from machine washable face masks and don't 
            already have a plan to get some, please let me know. My personal limit for this is ~20 masks, but if it's really important, I might be 
            able to get help from the rest of the sewing group. This pro bono work includes making face masks for eployees (and possibly their volunteers) 
            of local businesses that are suffering due to covid.<br><br>
            Contact:<br>
            Please email me at endlessneuwalder@gmail.com if you have questions, concerns, comments, suggestions, or advice, or you would like to purchase face mask(s). If you have another way of getting in touch with me, feel free to use that instead! 
            (Don't use Instagram to try and get in touch with me though, I check my email more)

    <h2>Images of available fabrics for face masks!</h2>
        <p id="description">
        Here are pictures of the current fabrics. You may have to zoom in to see them properly. You request a mask by its request name. 
        Some mask patterns are either temporarly or permanently unavailable, or soon to become so. If this is true, it will say so in the notes!
        If you have already requested a pattern, this unavailability might be due to you, and you should not worry! 
        (but if you are worried, don't hesitate to reach out!)
