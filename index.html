                Hi I'm Emi, I love origami, crochet, and reading books. I go to the commonwealth school and love music.
                My favorite book series is The Mysterious Benedict Society. While not reading, or crafting, I can be found participating in plays and performances.
                The picture below is from the production of <i>Carmen</i> that I was in.

        <p> From 3rd or 4th grade onward, The Mysterious Benedict Society book series by Trento Lee Stewart
         was my favorite thing to read. The books are each ~470 pages long, and I'm fairly sure that I've read 
         each of them at least 3 times.

        At the beginning of 8th grade, I had the great excitement of performing as a street urchin in George Bizet's opera, <i>Carmen</i>. 
        I'm the one in the aqua headband on the left.
