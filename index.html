                Hi I'm Emi. I go to the Commonwealth School near Copley, and almost every day 
                (in the winter months), I take the MBTA to and from school. I leave for school
                fairly close to the time of sunrise, and often come home around sunset. I recently got
                very into taking photographs of whatever was interesting on my commute, particularly 
                focusing on the sky. I also started a collection just of a particular view from my 
                morning bus stop (facing east) of all the different bits of sky. The one on the left
                is the one that started off this idea, and is my personal favorite. Each picture that 
                I take is chosen for some very particular reason.

            <p> From 3rd or 4th grade onward, The Mysterious Benedict Society book series by Trento Lee Stewart
         was my favorite thing to read. The books are each ~470 pages long, and I'm fairly sure that I've read 
         each of them at least 3 times.
